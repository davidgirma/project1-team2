### Topics Covered:

**Mexico's Gross domestic product (GDP):**
Mexico's GDP has shown significant fluctuations over the past decade. The industry sector consistently contributing the highest value to Mexico’s GDP is the manufacturing sector. This sector includes automotive, electronics, and other high-value manufacturing industries. In terms of growth, the services sector, particularly tourism and IT services, has seen substantial expansion, contributing increasingly to the nation's GDP.

**Foreign Direct Investment (FDI):**
Foreign Direct Investment in Mexico has been predominantly driven by countries like the United States, Canada, and Spain. These investments are mainly concentrated in the manufacturing and energy sectors, reflecting Mexico's strategic importance in these industries. The automotive industry, in particular, has attracted substantial FDI, boosting industrial growth and technological advancements.

**International Purchases:**
Mexico’s international purchases have been dominated by imports from countries such as the United States, China, and Germany. Over the last decade, the top imports include machinery, electronics, vehicles, and medical equipment. This trade dynamic underscores Mexico's reliance on these key economies for critical goods and technological products.

**Foreign Trade:**
Foreign trade is a vital component of Mexico's economy, with significant contributions from various states. The top 15 states with major foreign trade activities include Mexico City, Nuevo León, and Jalisco, among others. These states have robust industrial bases and strategic locations that facilitate extensive trade operations, enhancing their economic stature.

**Trade Value Growth:**
Trade value growth in Mexico has experienced shifts due to global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic severely impacted the automotive and aerospace sectors, leading to a temporary decline in exports. However, sectors such as pharmaceuticals and electronics have shown resilience and significant growth, adapting to the changing global demands.
